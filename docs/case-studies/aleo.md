## Private Apps


  
### Development
Aleo uses [`aleo`](https://github.com/AleoHQ/aleo) language, which is a low level, assembly-like language used to implement program logic. It compiles into zkSNARK circuits. There is also a higher level version of `aleo`, called [`leo`](https://github.com/AleoHQ/leo). It comes with it's own toolset, with `leo` cli. `leo` can be used to bootstrap a new private app, build prover/verifier circuits, run transition function, and deploy to a [`snarkOS`](https://github.com/AleoHQ/snarkOS), the official Aleo validator node.
